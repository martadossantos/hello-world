# hello-world
I can see mountains further ahead.

If I didn't know better I would walk to the mountains. 
Many of those who come here walk to the mountains, they never come back.
Somehow, the population keeps getting smaller and smaller, the mountains bigger and bigger.
Some days we can hear the mountains breathe.
